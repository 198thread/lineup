# lineup
face database when browsing

## Demo 


## Aim

Puzzle pieces ask us to recognise from reference:
```mermaid
graph LR;
    A(((10001/10001 pieces left))) --> B{{Blue Puzzle Piece}}
    B -.-> C([Sky?])
    B -.-> D([Sea?])
    B -.-> E([Blue petticoat?])
```

```mermaid
graph LR;
    A(((11 pieces left))) --> B{{Green Puzzle Piece}}
    B --> E[[Tree on Left]]
    A --> C{{Dark-Blue Puzzle Piece}}
    C --> D[[Sea]]
    A --> F{{Light-Blue Puzzle Piece}}
    F --> G[[Sky]]
```
Machine learning gives up some ways to reduce the Î”time it takes to build up references.

As PJ Vogt's [Search Engine podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/should-this-creepy-search-engine-exist/id1614253637?i=1000655151849) discusses, this is possible for faces.

## Mechanism

Using face-recognition to build up the reference list in a database, the lineup browser extension can allow for all faces found while browsing to later be checked. 

This software uncouples the browsing and the reference list.

Multiple people, on different browsers, can share the same database of references.

```mermaid
graph BT;
    B(firefox) <--> A[(face_db)]
    C{{librewolf}} <--> A
    D(firefox) <--> A
    E(firefox) <--> A
    F{{librewolf}} <--> A
```
